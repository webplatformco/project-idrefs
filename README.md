# Improving DX of HTML Element References

Authors: Lea Verou, Noam Rosenthal

## Motivation

Many HTML attributes need to reference one or more HTML elements in the document.
This includes:

- `for`, in `<label>` and `<output>`
- `list` in `<input>`
- A host of ARIA attributes (e.g. `aria-describedby`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-activedescendant`, `aria-controls`, `aria-details`, `aria-flowto`, `aria-owns` etc.)
- Popovers (`popovertarget`)
- Command Invokers (`commandfor`)
- Interest Invokers (`interestfor`)
- [`<template patchfor>`](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11542)

It is also a frequent use case in author web components as well, for example:
- [`<wa-popover for>`](https://webawesome.com/docs/components/popover)
- [`<wa-tooltip for>`](https://webawesome.com/docs/components/tooltip)
- [`<wa-copy-button>`](https://webawesome.com/docs/components/copy-button/#copying-values-from-other-elements)

Currently, the only way to specify such references is through `id` references and using these ids to link to them in these attributes.
Some elements allow implicit associations (such as nesting a form control within a `<label>`) but most do not.

This imposes high friction, as authors then need to come up with globally unique suitable ids for elements that wouldn't otherwise have one and keep them in sync across all references.
It also introduces unnecessary error conditions; it is a common authoring mistake to change an id and forgetting to change the id references to it, or pasting a chunk of HTML and forgetting to edit all references.

This *especially* hurts accessibility, since the effects of broken references in the AT are not always obvious, and the more friction it takes to make HTML accessible, the less likely authors are to do it.

## Pain points

### Conflicts

According to an [HTTP archive query](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19hmR_DoeQ8k8I0f_SI9QHoZy9omU_OEp5zjP8sjB954/edit?usp=sharing), roughly 45% of all HTML responses in July 2025 had multiple occurences of the same ID.
Correcting for declarative shadow DOM would only make a small dent in this number.

Since IDs are global to the document or shadow root, and resolved in document order, having the same ID multiple times in the same document is very likely to cause conflicts.
This kind of conflict can be a bug that reaches users, when e.g. labels don't target the correct input.

### Verbosity & friction

To overcome conflicts, developers have to either create some namespacing scheme that works across their entire document or shadow tree, or rely on UUIDs. At the very least, they need to add ID as a superfluous addition to an element:

```html
<form>
  <label for=searchInput>Search</label>
  <input type=search name=search id=searchInput>
</form>
```

For labels in particular there is some contextual way to do this without IDs, but this doesn't necessarily scale to all the other IDREFs.

### Inability to reuse HTML & SVG snippets

A major pain point identified around IDs is with its impact on being able to reuse existing HTML/SVG.
For example, an existing SVG snippet might include some IDs for its internal use, e.g. for referencing filters or `<use>`.

When embedding these snippets or repeating them, the IDREFs would now reference the first occurence of the snippet, or would interfere with other IDREFs in the document.
Since the implications of this might only present themselves to accessibility-tree users, the developer might not even notice.

This usually means that HTML/SVG snippets cannot be safely embedded, and developers have to funnel them through a framework or a library that produces unique IDs, potentially breaking some of the internal relations.
Some developers don't bother doing this and end up with broken references, or avoid reusing HTML/SVG snippets altogether for this reason.

## User research

This is a very common author pain point, and authors are pretty vocal about it.
DX-related complaints were the 3rd biggest a11y complaint in the preliminary State of HTML results 2023.

User research has moved to [research.md](research.md).


## Current workarounds

- React `useId()`
- Templating
- Convention-based namespacing
- Some management of IDs in a central location

### Goals

- Reduce conflicts that arise from IDs being global
- Reduce friction of linking to another element for authors, do not require tooling for reasonable DX
- Improve robustness of element references (reduce broken references)

### Non-goals

TBD

## Requirements

- Old global `id` references should be able to co-exist with the new more robust references, even on the same element.
This eases the migration path for authors and ensures existing UI libraries and other tooling that modify HTML continue to work.
Additionally, there are use cases where the referencing desired is genuinely global (e.g. a "country" field would need to autocomplete to the same list of countries everywhere and it makes sense for it to link to a single `<datalist>`).
- Ability to copy/paste fragments of HTML without breakage is a nice-to-have

## Existing Element-Cross-Referencing Systems

### IDs

The target element gets a string ID, in the `id` attribute,
which is meant to be unique within its `Document` or `ShadowRoot`.
The source element repeats this string
in an "IDREF" attribute tied to the purpose of the reference.
For example, `for`, `commandfor`, `popovertarget`, `aria-activedescendant` etc.
This creates a reference to the _first_ element with that ID in the same `Document` or `ShadowRoot`.
"First" since authors can always break the rule that these are unique.

Most of these references want to identify a single target element,
but [`aria-labelledby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
and [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-describedby)
take lists of IDs.

#### Advantages

* Creates [automatic JS variable references](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/nav-history-apis.html#named-access-on-the-window-object). ([@davatron5000](https://mastodon.social/@davatron5000/115049859936635912))
* Creates a URL fragment pointing to that element. ([@gumnos](https://mastodon.bsd.cafe/@gumnos/115050068997019695))

#### Disadvantages

See https://notes.igalia.com/XlsPwU5sQfuaWYHwhtBMtA.

* Difficult to guarantee uniqueness.
  * Across page changes ([@gumnos](https://mastodon.bsd.cafe/@gumnos/115050068997019695))
  * When referencing inside a component that's instantiated multiple times ([@AmeliaBR](https://front-end.social/@AmeliaBR/115050773810656300), [@theadhocracy](https://indieweb.social/@theadhocracy/115050928274082878))
  * When combining different tools ([@AmeliaBR](https://front-end.social/@AmeliaBR/115050814509549309))
  * When referencing across _different_ components ([@ragnar-oock](https://bsky.app/profile/ragnar-oock.bsky.social/post/3lwrwswxum226))
    * This developer disagrees that intra-component references are difficult,
      because JS libraries have developed workarounds.
      ([@ragnar-oock](https://bsky.app/profile/ragnar-oock.bsky.social/post/3lwrwsxmtis26))
  * Frequently have to append a uuid or database ID to make it prefixed but unique, which means JS required.
    ([@davatron5000](https://mastodon.social/@davatron5000/115049859841887277))
  * Some ways of generating unique IDs make otherwise-unmodified pages in static sites
    appear to change on every build.
    ([@thomasjaggi](https://bsky.app/profile/thomasjaggi.bsky.social/post/3lwsnc3rqss2t))
* Lots of noisy duplication between properties like: href, for, aria-controls, aria-labeledby, aria-describedby, anchor-name idents, etc. Then IDs like foo-123, foo-label-123, foo-error-123, foo-tab-123, foo-tab-panel-123, etc. ([@davatron5000](https://mastodon.social/@davatron5000/115049859841887277))
* Brittle if ID changes or wired wrong ([@davatron5000](https://mastodon.social/@davatron5000/115049859936635912))
* ShadowDOM breaks a lot of uses. ([@AmeliaBR](https://front-end.social/@AmeliaBR/115050773810656300))

## Potential solutions

Many solutions were discussed in [`whatwg/html#10143`](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10143).
This section attempts to summarize the general themes.

### General querying mechanisms

These solutions are around using a general element querying mechanism to reference elements, either by querying relative to the element doing the referencing or globally, possibly with an ancestor scoping element.

#### Querying language

XPath was discussed, but consensus was largely that if we go down this path, CSS selectors are better as:
1. Authors are more familiar with them
2. They are being actively developed, and
3. There is a lot of UA code optimizing their matching

#### Syntax

- Using selectors directly in existing attributes, with a discarded prefix to specify that a selector, rather than an id, is being used, e.g. `<label for="@ & + input">`
- Using separate attributes with a consistent naming scheme, e.g. `<label forselect="& + input">` or `<label for$="& + input">`

#### Scoping

Many proposals involved using an ancestor element for scoping, to simplify the selectors necessary.
For example, to refer to the first `input` within the closest `section` one could use a general selector, but the syntax would be fairly complex: `section:not(:has(section &)):has(&) input`.

Introducing something like [lazy combinators](https://lea.verou.me/specs/lazy-combinators/) could simplify it to `& << section input`.

But being able to define `section` as the scoping element, would simplify it further to just `input`.

Scoping mechanisms could be:
- A microsyntax within the reference, e.g. `@scope (section) input`
- A separate attribute, e.g. `<label forscope="section">`
- An attribute on the scoping element, e.g. `<section refscope>`

### Identifier-based references

These solutions are around using identifiers but scoping them to an ancestor element.

#### Identifier attributes

- Continuing to use `id`, paired with a new `idscope` attribute on the scoping element, e.g. `<section idscope="section">`
- Using other existing one-to-many identifier attributes such as `name`, `class`, `itemprop` etc
- Introducing a new attribute, e.g. `ref`

#### Scoping behavior

- Fail if no element matches the reference within the scope
- Match in the closest scope first. If nothing found, continue searching in the next closest scope, all the way up to the root.

#### Scoping mechanisms

- A boolean attribute on the scoping element, e.g. `<section refscope>`
- An attribute that customizes the matching algorithm for ids, e.g. `idscope="local|global"` with no value being equivalent to `local`
- Implicit: Just improving the matching algorithm from "get the first element with this id" to something "smarter" (e.g. the same as if `idscope` had been used on every element)
- An explicit "export" attribute on the scoping element, inspired by `exportparts` e.g. `<section exportids="foo:bar, baz">`. Possibly paired with an `importids` attribute for the reverse.
- An opt-in with `exportid` attributes on the elements whose ids we want to export (with our without a value). Better locality than `exportids`.
